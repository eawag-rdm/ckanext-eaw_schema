    <p>Select the system(s) to which the data in this <i>package</i> refers to.</p>
    <p>This is a controlled vocabulary and you can only select
    pre-defined terms.</p>
    <p>It is likely that one or several Systems, which would
      make sense for this package, are not yet in this list. In this
      case, please note that in the <i>Notes</i>-field.</p>
    <p>In case you can think of <i>Systems</i> that
      should be added to the list but do not pertain to
      this <i>package</i> specifically, please note them enclosed in
      parentheses:<br />"<b>(</b>New_System<b>)</b>".</p>
    <p>As a rule of thumb, <i>System</i> denotes a spacial and/or
    functional delineation of the realm in which measurements took
    place. Prototypical <i>Systems</i> in that sense are the
    environmental compartments.</p>
    <p style="background-color:yellow;">
      <span>This is a mandatory field.</span>  <br />
      <span>Select <i>none</i>
	if and only if <i>Systems</i> does not apply to this
	package.</span>
