                        Select the term(s) that are characteristic for the <i>package</i>.

                        This is a controlled vocabulary and you can only select
                        pre-defined terms.

                    <p>
                        It is likely that one or several generic terms, which would
                        make sense for this package, are not yet in this list. In this
                        case, please note that in the <i>Notes</i>-field.

                        In case you can think of <i>Generic Terms</i> for this field that
                        should be added to the list but do not pertain to
                        this <i>package</i> specifically, please note them enclosed in
                        parentheses:
                        <br />
                        "<b>(</b>New_Generic_Term<b>)</b>".

                    <p>
                        As a rule of thumb, <i>Genric Terms</i> denote relevant groups
                        of organisms or substances with a common word that is meaningful
                        to non-experts.
