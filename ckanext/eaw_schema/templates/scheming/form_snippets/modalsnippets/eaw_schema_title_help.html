      <p>A well chosen title for this <i>data package</i>.</p>
      <p>In case you are creating a <i> publication data package</i>,
	i.e., a package that supplies data for a specific publication,
	the title should be of the form:
	<p>
	  "<b>Data for:</b> &lt;<tt>title of associated publication</tt>&gt;"
	</p>
      </p>
      <p>The URL is being filled in automatically, but you can change
	it to any not yet used value that makes sense as URL. That is
	useful if you have a rather long title and get an error
	message that complains about a too long URL: You might just
	want to truncate it.
