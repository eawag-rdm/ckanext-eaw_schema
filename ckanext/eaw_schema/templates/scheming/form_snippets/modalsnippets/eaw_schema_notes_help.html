	This is a mult-purpose field to store and communicate
	information about the package that is not otherwise covered
	and also about the submission process itself. That can be for
	example:
      </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notes for the users of this dataset that are not covered by the
        other metadata fields.</li>
      <li>Notes for the Eawag data-manager regarding shortcomings of
	the metadata fields, specific problems with this package,
	etc.</li>
      <li> Notes for yourself, in case you will be finishing the
        submission later and want to remember something regarding this
        package.</li>
    </ol>
