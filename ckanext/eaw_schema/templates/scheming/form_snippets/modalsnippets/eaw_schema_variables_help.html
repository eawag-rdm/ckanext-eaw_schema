    <p>Select the variable(s) for which measurements are contained in
      the <i>package</i>.</p>
    <p>This is a controlled vocabulary and you can only select
    pre-defined terms.</p>
    <p>It is likely that variables you measured are not yet in this
      list. In this case, please note that in
      the <i>Notes</i>-field.</p>
    <p>As a rule of thumb, everything that has a unit is potentially
      a <i>Variable</i>.</p>
    <p>In case you can think of relevant terms for this field that
      should be added to the list but do not pertain to
      this <i>package</i> specifically, please note them enclosed in
      parentheses: "<b>(</b>New_Variable<b>)</b>".</p>

      <span>This is a mandatory field.</span>  <br />
