                        Entering the spatial extent of your data is currently not yet
                        supported in a user-friendly manner. In case the field
                        "<b>Geographic Name(s)</b>" does not describe the spatial
                        reference of you data precisely enough (for example beacuse your
                        measurements do not pertain to a whole lake but rather to a
                        specific spot in that lake), please make a note (to yourself and
                        the administrator of this platform) in the <b>Notes</b> field
                        about where that information can be found.

                        In case you want to see your data on the map now you have to
                        enter the spatial coverage of the data in the package as GeoJSON
                        - geometry. Possible types are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Point",</li>
                            <li>"MultiPoint",</li>
                            <li>"LineString",</li>
                            <li>"MultiLineString",</li>
                            <li>"Polygon",</li>
                            <li>"MultiPolygon"</li>
